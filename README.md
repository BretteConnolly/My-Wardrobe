Outfit generator. Assembles combinations of 3-20 items from a base of 56 categories, based on which items have been worn the least. Prioritizes which categories to shop for by calculating: the frequency each item category is worn measured against a target frequency, the surplus number of items versus the minimum requirement to fulfill the target frequency, and the surplus as a percentage of the minimum requirement, then ranks the surpluses in ascending order.
